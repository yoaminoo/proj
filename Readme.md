## Introduction

This is a program written in Java, inspired by the "Genius" application.

The application simulates a music platform where users can sign up as regular listeners, artists, or administrators. Using object-oriented design, the project organizes data into accounts, songs, albums, and comments.

## Features

### **Accounts and Role Management**
- **User:** Browse song lyrics, comment on songs, and follow artists.
- **Artist:** Create and manage songs and albums, update lyrics directly.
- **Admin:** Review, approve, or reject artist registrations and user-submitted lyric edits.

### **Songs**
- Each song contains a name, artist, album, genre, lyric, view count, likes, and dislikes.
- Every time a song is viewed, its view count increases.
- Users can like/dislike songs and comment on them.

### **Albums**
- Albums group together songs by an artist.
- Albums include a title and artist name.

### **Comments**
- Users can leave comments on songs.
- Comments are displayed along with the username of the commenter.

### **Search Functionality**
- Search for artists, songs, or albums using a case-insensitive match.

## Project Structure

The project is designed using modular packages to keep concerns separated and to follow clean OOP principles.

There are **seven main packages** in the projectâ€”some are essential, like `Signup`, `Account`, `Song`, and `Display`, while others, such as `CS`, `P`, and `PrintObj`, help you code easier.

### **Package Overview**
1. **Signup and Login**
2. **Account, User, Artist, and Admin**
3. **Song, Album, and Comment**
4. **Search**
5. **FileManager**
6. **Display**
7. **P, CS, toString, and PrintObj**
